# My Family website
A website I am making for my family to use to store their personal files wherever they go. Like a Google-Drive alternative, but with personalized features:

  - [ ] Make the file serving functions from `get` requests
- [ ] Front-end
  - [ ] Make the Login page
  - [ ] Make the add-new user page
  - [ ] Authenticate the Login page with the backend to login
  - [ ] Make a Home page
  - [ ] Authenticate the home page to get requests for the specific user
